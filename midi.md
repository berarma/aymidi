Fixed sets the frequency for the fixed square/buzzer/ringmod.
Detune is used with the square/buzzer and square/ringmod combinations.
Ringmod with low detune is better known as SID effect.
Ringmod depth is how much low the volume is set (0-15). A value of 15 disables the effect.
Pitch Attack is how much to raise the tone in semitones during the Attack phase.
